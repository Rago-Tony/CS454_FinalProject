Problem Description: <br>
Given two strings x and y of the same length N over a finite alphabet Σ of size M. <br>
(N and M are user inputs so your solution should work for arbitrary N and M.) <br>
Consider a game involving two players A and B. A random string over the alphabet Σ is generated until x or y appears.  <br>
(You can assume that x and y do not have a common prefix (other than the null string.) <br>
If the game terminates with the appearance of x (y), player 1 (2) wins.<br>
This program takes as input the strings x and y, and outputs the probability that A wins. <br>
